# DEI-Dashboard-Analysis-PowerBI
This project presents a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) dashboard built in Power BI, aimed at analyzing representation, performance, promotion, and attrition trends by gender and department. It is developed as part of a self-learning initiative to enhance my data storytelling and stakeholder communication skills as a data analyst.

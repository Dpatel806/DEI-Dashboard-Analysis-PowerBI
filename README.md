# DEI-Dashboard-Analysis-PowerBI
This project presents a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) dashboard built in Power BI, aimed at analyzing representation, performance, promotion, and attrition trends by gender and department. It is developed as part of a self-learning initiative to enhance my data storytelling and stakeholder communication skills as a data analyst.

## 📌 Objective
To visualize and explore workplace DEI metrics to help organizations understand disparities in employee outcomes and support data-driven decisions in HR and leadership.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Gender representation breakdown by department and job role

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified gender imbalances in specific departments.
